498,@VirginAmerica just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome
499,@VirginAmerica morning. If I have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can I DM you?
500,@VirginAmerica still waiting to see  @Starryeyes_Dev_  üòû
501,@VirginAmerica was wondering if you guys recieved my dm and we're able to potentially respond asap
502,@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
503,‚Äú@VirginAmerica: Book out of town with fares from $59/way (+restr). http://t.co/xRdTOV7nl8 http://t.co/4Y78byAckc‚Äù @JenniferDawnPro
504,@united thanks
505,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
506,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
507,@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
508,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
509,@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
510,@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
511,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
512,"@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price."
513,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
514,@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta
515,@united thanks
516,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
517,@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
518,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
519,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
520,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
521,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
522,"@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system."
523,"@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child"
524,@united Just submitted my response on the link you sent.
525,"@united yes, David Allan send an email with this number (KMM24999563V99860L0KM) and case#8719519"
526,@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
527,@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated
528,"@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015"
529,@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
530,"@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
531,"@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?"
532,@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
533,"@united thats weak. See ya üëã
Hey @VirginAmerica !!"
534,@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
535,@united I lost a voucher that I was given in Miami aeroport on jan 26. I did not use it.
536,@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
537,@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
538,@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
539,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
540,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
541,@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
542,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
543,@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
544,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
545,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
546,@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
547,@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
548,"@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations"
549,@united i DMed you the details
550,"@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"
551,"@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was ""Inop"". I love a good abbreve."
552,"@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer."
553,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
554,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
555,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
556,@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
557,@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
558,"@united ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU"
559,"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
560,@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
561,@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
562,@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
563,@united rude rude
564,@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
565,@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
566,@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
567,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
568,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
569,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
570,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
571,@united 6533 ORD to DCA
572,"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
573,@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
574,@united I will not be flying you again
575,"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
576,"@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!"
577,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
578,@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
579,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
580,"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
581,@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
582,@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
583,@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
584,"@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement."
585,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
586,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
587,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
588,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
589,"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
590,@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
591,"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
592,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
593,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
594,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
595,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
596,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
597,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
598,@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
599,@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
600,@united thx for update
601,@united thank you !
602,@united dm these nuts
603,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
604,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
605,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
606,@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
607,@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
608,@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever

611,"@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy."
612,@united thanks for the info I already knew...
613,@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
614,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
615,@united Thank you.
616,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
617,@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
618,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
619,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
620,@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
621,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
622,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
623,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
624,@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
625,@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
626,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
627,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
628,@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
629,"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
630,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
631,"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
632,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
633,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
634,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
635,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
636,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
637,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
638,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
639,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
640,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
641,@united please be good to me this weekend!
642,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
643,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
644,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
645,@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
646,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
647,@united yall should probably work on that.
648,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
649,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
650,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
651,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
652,@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
653,@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
654,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
655,@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
656,@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
657,@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
658,@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
659,@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
660,"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
661,@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
662,@united DM does not work what do I do?
663,@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
664,@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
665,@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
666,@united how about 3659 YUL-ORD?
667,"@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx"
668,@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know

670,"@united thanks, just sent :)"
671,"@united I'm grounded in Montreal with ua3659. I am missing my connection ua3417 to St. Louis. Can you help,Do you have a private jet for me?"
672,@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
673,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
674,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
675,@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
676,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
677,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
678,@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
679,.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
680,"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
681,"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
682,@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
683,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
684,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
685,@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
686,@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
687,@united thnx for the info
688,@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
689,"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
690,@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
691,@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
692,@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
693,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
694,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
695,@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
696,@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
697,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
698,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
699,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
700,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
701,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
702,@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
703,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
704,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
705,@united Okay thank you
706,@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
707,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
708,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
709,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
710,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
711,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
712,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
713,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
714,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
715,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
716,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
717,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
718,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
719,@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
720,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
721,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
722,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
723,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
724,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
725,@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
726,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
727,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
728,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
729,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
730,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
731,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
732,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
733,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
734,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
735,@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
736,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
737,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
738,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
739,@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
740,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
741,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
742,"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
743,@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
744,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
745,‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
746,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
747,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
748,@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
749,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
750,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
751,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
752,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
753,@united yes I do.
754,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
755,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
756,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
757,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
758,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
759,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
760,@united Deep Vein thrombosis
761,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
762,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
763,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
764,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
765,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
766,@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
767,‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
768,@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
769,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
770,@united DM sent
771,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
772,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
773,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
774,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
775,@united But thanks for asking
776,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
777,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
778,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
779,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
780,"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
781,@united you too!
782,@united is my favorite airline.
783,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
784,@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
785,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
786,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
787,@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
788,@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
789,@united why would they make me share a room?
790,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
791,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
792,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
793,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
794,"@united i understand, thanks"
795,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
796,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
797,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
798,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
799,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
800,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
801,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
802,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
803,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
804,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
805,"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
806,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
807,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
808,@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
809,"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
810,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
811,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
812,@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
813,@united I hope so too
814,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
815,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
816,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
817,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
818,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
819,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
820,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
821,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
822,@united where is my flight voucher?
823,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
824,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
825,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
826,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
827,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
828,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
829,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
830,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
831,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
832,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
833,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
834,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
835,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
836,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
837,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
838,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
839,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
840,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
841,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
842,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
843,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
844,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
845,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
846,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
847,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
848,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
849,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
850,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
851,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
852,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
853,"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
854,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
855,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
856,@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
857,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
858,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
859,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
860,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
861,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
862,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
863,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
864,@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
865,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
866,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
867,@united thank you.
868,Decisions Decisions @MandarinJourney @united:  We'd love for you to try our service. We offer status match too. http://t.co/xbQqqbRgVF ^KP‚Äù

870,"@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a ""wrong"" price on your site‚Äîit's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness."
871,@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
872,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"

874,@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
875,@united Dmed you. Thank you
876,@united thanks we'll be in touch!
877,@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
878,"@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story"
879,"@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?"
880,@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
881,@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
882,@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
883,@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
884,"@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!"

890,@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
891,@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
892,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
893,@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
894,@united where's my damn bag??
895,@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
896,@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
897,@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
898,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
899,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
900,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
901,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
902,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
903,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
904,Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
905,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
906,@United so what‚Äôs the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
907,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
908,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
909,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
910,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
911,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
912,@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver

921,"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
922,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
923,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
924,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
925,@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
926,@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
927,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
928,@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
929,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
930,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
931,@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
932,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
933,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
934,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
935,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
936,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
937,@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
938,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
939,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
940,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
941,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
942,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
943,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
944,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
945,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
946,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
947,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."

951,"@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home"
952,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
953,@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
954,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
955,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
956,@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
957,@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
958,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
959,@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well

961,"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"

966,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
967,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
968,"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
969,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
970,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
971,@united is the worst airline in the world.
972,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
973,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
974,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
975,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
976,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
977,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
978,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
979,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
980,@united I think DM would be better
981,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
982,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
983,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
984,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
985,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
986,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
987,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
988,@united done
989,"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
990,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
991,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
992,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
993,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
994,@united thank you
995,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
996,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
997,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
998,@united he has no priority and Iove it
999,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
1000,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
1001,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
1002,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
1003,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
1004,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
1005,"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
1006,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
1007,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
1008,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
1009,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
1010,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
1011,Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
1012,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
1013,"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
1014,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
1015,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
1016,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
1017,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
1018,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
1019,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
1020,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
1021,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
1022,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
1023,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
1024,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
1025,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
1026,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
1027,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
1028,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
1029,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
1030,.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
1031,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
1032,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
1033,@united Ok thank again for your help!
1034,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
1035,Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
1036,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
1037,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
1038,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
1039,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
1040,"@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
1041,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
1042,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
1043,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
1044,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
1045,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
1046,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
1047,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
1048,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
1049,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
1050,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
1051,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
1052,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
1053,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
1054,"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
1055,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
1056,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
1057,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
1058,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
1059,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
1060,Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
1061,But I don't see AA @united
1062,@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
1063,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
1064,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
1065,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
1066,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
1067,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
1068,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
1069,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
1070,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
1071,@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
1072,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
1073,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
1074,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
1075,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
1076,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
1077,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
1078,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
1079,@united ok thx!
1080,@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
1081,@united go to hell
1082,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
1083,@united Definitely will!
1084,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
1085,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
1086,@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
1087,@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
1088,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
1089,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
1090,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
1091,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
1092,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
1093,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
1094,@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
1095,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
1096,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
1097,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
1098,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
1099,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
1100,@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
1101,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
1102,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
1103,@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
1104,@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
1105,@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
1106,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
1107,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
1108,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
1109,"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"
1110,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
1111,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
1112,"@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3"
1113,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
1114,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
1115,@united already missed  connection ugh
1116,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
1117,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
1118,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
1119,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
1120,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
1121,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
1122,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
1123,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
1124,@united that's not even an apology
1125,@united that's cool - now what?
1126,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
1127,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
1128,@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
1129,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
1130,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
1131,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
1132,@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
1133,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
1134,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
1135,@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
1136,"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"

1140,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
1141,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
1142,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
1143,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
1144,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
1145,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
1146,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
1147,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
1148,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
1149,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.
1150,@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
1151,@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi

1153,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."

1155,@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
1156,@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket

1158,"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."

1169,@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
1170,@united thank you!
1171,@united Thanks for the update.
1172,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
1173,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
1174,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
1175,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
1176,@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
1177,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
1178,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
1179,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
1180,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
1181,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
1182,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
1183,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
1184,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
1185,@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
1186,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
1187,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
1188,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
1189,@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
1190,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
1191,@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
1192,@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
1193,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
1194,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
1195,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
1196,@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
1197,@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
1198,"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
1199,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
1200,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
1201,@united please see dm!!
1202,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
1203,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
1204,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
1205,@united still no response??
1206,@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
1207,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
1208,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
1209,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
1210,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
1211,@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?

1220,"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
1221,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."

1251,"@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!"

1289,@united hilarious
1290,@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
1291,@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
1292,"@United ""Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."""
1293,@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
1294,"@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm"
1295,"@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee"

1301,@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
1302,@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
1303,"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
1304,UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.

1312,@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother
1313,@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
1314,@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
1315,@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
1316,"@united I guess you have to ""follow"" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send."
1317,@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
1318,"@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback"
1319,@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?

1321,"@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?"
1322,"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa"

1325,@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
1326,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
1327,"@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your ""Premier"" groups might be an indication of a broken process."
1328,@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
1329,@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to youüòä http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E

1334,@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
1335,@united literally sucks
1336,@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
1337,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
1338,"@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues"
1339,@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.

1367,@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
1368,"@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue"
1369,"@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 (""uplink prob""). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?"
1370,@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.

1373,@united In Ethiopia adopting a child.  Need flight home from ADD to GRR Late Flight 2/27 or very early 2/28. (need to change existing reservation)
1374,"@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!"
1375,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
1376,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
1377,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
1378,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
1379,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
1380,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
1381,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
1382,@united I wanna be grand staff
1383,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
1384,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
1385,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
1386,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
1387,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
1388,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
1389,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
1390,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
1391,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
1392,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
1393,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
1394,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
1395,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
1396,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
1397,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
1398,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
1399,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
1400,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
1401,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
1402,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
1403,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
1404,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
1405,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
1406,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
1407,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
1408,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
1409,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
1410,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
1411,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
1412,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
1413,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
1414,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
1415,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
1416,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
1417,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
1418,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
1419,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
1420,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
1421,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
1422,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
1423,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
1424,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
1425,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
1426,@united it will be on a different airline.
1427,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
1428,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
1429,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
1430,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
1431,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
1432,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
1433,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
1434,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
1435,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
1436,@united i need help but in spanish
1437,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
1438,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
1439,@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
1440,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
1441,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...

1445,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
1446,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
1447,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
1448,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
1449,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
1450,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
1451,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
1452,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
1453,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
1454,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
1455,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
1456,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
1457,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
1458,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
1459,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
1460,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
1461,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
1462,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
1463,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
1464,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
1465,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
1466,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
1467,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
1468,@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
1469,@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
1470,@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
1471,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
1472,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
1473,@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
1474,‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
1475,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
1476,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
1477,@united thank you!
1478,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
1479,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
1480,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
1481,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
1482,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
1483,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
1484,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
1485,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
1486,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
1487,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
1488,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
1489,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
1490,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
1491,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
1492,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
1493,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
1494,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
1495,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
1496,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
1497,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
1498,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
1499,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
1500,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
1501,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
1502,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
1503,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
1504,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
1505,@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
1506,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
1507,@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
1508,@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
1509,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
1510,@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
1511,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
1512,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
1513,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
1514,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
1515,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
1516,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
1517,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
1518,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
1519,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
1520,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
1521,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
1522,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
1523,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
1524,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
1525,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
1526,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
1527,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
1528,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
1529,@united lol too little too Late Flight
1530,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
1531,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1532,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
1533,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
1534,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
1535,@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
1536,@united your seats are god awful.
1537,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
1538,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
1539,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
1540,@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
1541,"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
1542,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
1543,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
1544,@united i sure will
1545,@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
1546,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
1547,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
1548,@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home üôåüôå
1549,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
1550,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
1551,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
1552,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
1553,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1554,@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
1555,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
1556,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
1557,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
1558,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1559,@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
1560,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
1561,@united I need help with a missing bag.
1562,@united I was. But I have given up.
1563,"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
1564,@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
1565,@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
1566,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
1567,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
1568,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
1569,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
1570,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
1571,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
1572,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
1573,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
1574,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
1575,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
1576,@united thank you for following up!
1577,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
1578,@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
1579,"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
1580,@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
1581,@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
1582,@United can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight?
1583,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
1584,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
1585,@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
1586,@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
1587,@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
1588,@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
1589,@united no thanks
1590,@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
1591,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
1592,@united why do you hate your passengers?
1593,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
1594,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
1595,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
1596,@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
1597,@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
1598,@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
1599,@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
1600,@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
1601,@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
1602,"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
1603,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"
1604,@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
1605,"@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!"
1606,@united false.
1607,"@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all."
1608,"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."
1609,".@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim"
1610,"@united Good evening, UA. Can you assist with an issue via DM?"
1611,@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
1612,@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines

1615,"@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays."
1616,@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
1617,@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. üôÖüôÖüôÖ
1618,@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
1619,@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
1620,"@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard"
1621,@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots

1626,@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground &amp; somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
1627,@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
1628,"@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle."
1629,@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
1630,".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
1631,@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
1632,@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
1633,@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
1634,@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure
1635,"@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people."
1636,"@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all"

1662,@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
1663,@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
1664,@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
1665,@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
1666,@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
1667,@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
1668,"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."
1669,@united you guys are complete ass
1670,@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
1671,@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
1672,@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
1673,@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
1674,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
1675,@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
1676,@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
1677,@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!

1681,@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
1682,@united +the plane.
1683,"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
1684,@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
1685,"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
1686,"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
1687,@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
1688,@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
1689,@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
1690,@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
1691,"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
1692,@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
1693,@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
1694,"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"
1695,@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
1696,"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
1697,@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
1698,@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
1699,@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
1700,@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
1701,@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
1702,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
1703,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
1704,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
1705,@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
1706,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
1707,"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
1708,@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
1709,@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
1710,@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
1711,@united ouch not fair
1712,@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
1713,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
1714,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
1715,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
1716,"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
1717,@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
1718,@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
1719,@united I'll be calling tomorrow
1720,@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
1721,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
1722,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
1723,"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...‚úàÔ∏è"
1724,@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
1725,@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
1726,@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
1727,"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
1728,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
1729,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
1730,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
1731,@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
1732,@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
1733,"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
1734,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
1735,"@united Okay, just requested to follow."
1736,"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"

1738,"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
1739,@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
1740,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
1741,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
1742,"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
1743,"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
1744,@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
1745,@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
1746,"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
1747,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
1748,@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
1749,@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
1750,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
1751,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
1752,@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
1753,@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
1754,@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
1755,@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
1756,"@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst"

1758,"@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????"
1759,"@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !"
1760,@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
1761,@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
1762,@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
1763,@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
1764,"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
1765,@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
1766,@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
1767,"@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc"
1768,"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
1769,@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
1770,"@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol"

1775,@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
1776,@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
1777,"@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?"
1778,@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
1779,"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
1780,@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
1781,@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
1782,@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
1783,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
1784,"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
1785,@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
1786,"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"
1787,"@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good."
1788,@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN

1790,@united you guys are gay
1791,@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
1792,"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
1793,"@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered"
1794,@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
1795,@united no thank you
1796,"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
1797,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
1798,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
1799,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
1800,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
1801,@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
1802,"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
1803,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
1804,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
1805,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
1806,@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
1807,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
1808,"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
1809,Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
1810,@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
1811,@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
1812,"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should‚Äôve had yesterday, it‚Äôs $514 today. Thanks."
1813,@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
1814,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
1815,@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I

1822,@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
1823,@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
1824,@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help

1829,"@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went."

1832,@united Did you get your 757 Model?
1833,@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
1834,@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
1835,@united direct messages not going through please help
1836,"@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures"
1837,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
1838,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
1839,@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
1840,@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
1841,"@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium."
1842,@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
1843,@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
1844,"@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai"
1845,@united so what's the solution?
1846,@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
1847,@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
1848,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
1849,"@united we got it, thanks."
1850,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..

1866,@united pls follow for DM

1879,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
1880,@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
1881,@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
1882,@united pls follow for DM.
1883,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
1884,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
1885,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
1886,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
1887,@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
1888,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
1889,@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
1890,"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"

1892,@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
1893,@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain

1895,"@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together"
1896,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
1897,@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.

1900,@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
1901,@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
1902,"@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of ""pilots haven't arrived yet"" announcements."
1903,@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
1904,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
1905,@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
1906,@united same day flights
1907,@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
1908,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
1909,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!

1924,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight

1943,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta

2041,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
2042,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
2043,@united you hung up on me again.
2044,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
2045,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.

2047,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
2048,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
2049,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
2050,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
2051,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
2052,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
2053,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
2054,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
2055,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
2056,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
2057,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
2058,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
2059,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
2060,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
2061,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
2062,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550

2083,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
2084,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.

2161,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
2162,@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
2163,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
2164,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
2165,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
2166,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
2167,@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
2168,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
2169,"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
2170,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
2171,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
2172,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
2173,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
2174,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
2175,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
2176,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
2177,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
2178,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
2179,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
2180,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
2181,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
2182,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
2183,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
2184,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
2185,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
2186,@united U blow
2187,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
2188,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
2189,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
2190,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
2191,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
2192,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
2193,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
2194,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
2195,@united you're terrible.
2196,@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
2197,@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
2198,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
2199,"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
2200,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
2201,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
2202,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
2203,@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
2204,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
2205,@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
2206,@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
2207,@united and waiting
2208,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
2209,@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
2210,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
2211,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
2212,@united is the worst
2213,@united still waiting
2214,"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
2215,"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
2216,"@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?"
2217,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
2218,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
2219,@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
2220,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
2221,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
2222,@united following
2223,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
2224,@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
2225,@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
2226,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
2227,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"
2228,@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
2229,@united could really use your help getting our bags at IAD. We're headed to YOW but now going to YXU
2230,@united It appears there are six flights to Calgary tomorrow is this correct?

2234,"@united do u serve peanuts/nuts on yr flights yr policies r confusing contradictory advice Pls help #Anaphylaxis,will u ask those 2 refrain?"
2235,@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
2236,@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
2237,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
2238,@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
2239,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
2240,@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
2241,@united On flight 1220 right now...
2242,@united Can you help me get a flight out tonight to Houston?Just don't want to be stuck here till Monday with all this bad weather moving in
2243,@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
2244,@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
2245,@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
2246,@united hoping to get out earlier than 2/23 (only phone option) or assistance with hotel.
2247,@united having to pay for a hotel room in Cleveland because of last minute Cancelled Flightled connecting flight. Booked through united..Unimpressed!
2248,@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
2249,@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
2250,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
2251,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
2252,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
2253,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
2254,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
2255,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
2256,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
2257,@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
2258,@united never again.
2259,@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
2260,@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
2261,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
2262,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
2263,@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
2264,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
2265,@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
2266,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
2267,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
2268,@united sucks.
2269,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
2270,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2271,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
2272,@united where's the crew for ua748?
2273,@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
2274,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
2275,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
2276,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
2277,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
2278,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
2279,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
2280,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
2281,@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
2282,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
2283,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"
2284,@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
2285,@united thanks
2286,"@united hey, I missed my outbound flight - can I still use my return ticket?"
2287,@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
2288,@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
2289,@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
2290,@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
2291,@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
2292,@united The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/N2fvElcYgz
2293,@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
2294,@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
2295,@united - any way to get a message to an international flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
2296,@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
2297,@united you have a culture issue
2298,@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
2299,@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
2300,@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
2301,@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
2302,@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
2303,@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
2304,"@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!"
2305,"@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost"
2306,@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
2307,@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
2308,"@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?"
2309,@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
2310,@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
2311,@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.

2317,@united haven‚Äôt before and haven‚Äôt this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case‚Äînothing
2318,@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
2319,@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
2320,"@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags"
2321,"@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers"
2322,@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
2323,@united no wheelchairs
2324,"@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance"
2325,@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
2326,@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
2327,"@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations"
2328,@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
2329,"@united thanks, we did."
2330,"@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me."
2331,@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
2332,@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
2333,"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt"
2334,"@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection"
2335,"@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?"
2336,@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
2337,@united please don't take my membership away :(
2338,"@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning."
2339,"@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!"
2340,@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
2341,@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?

2345,So appreciated! @united
2346,@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
2347,@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!
2348,@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
2349,@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
2350,@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
2351,@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
2352,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
2353,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
2354,@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
2355,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
2356,@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
2357,@united SATURDAY this morning Man dies from Ebola http://t.co/hXVVIS0VWw
2358,@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.
2359,"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain"
2360,@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
2361,@united the worst customer service in Denver.
2362,"@united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ"
2363,@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?
2364,@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
2365,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
2366,@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
2367,"@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, ""not with my hands!"" #badservice"
2368,@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
2369,@united flight was Cancelled Flightled due to mechanical issues but when I ask for cab fare they say it was weather and can't help me
2370,"@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book"
2371,"@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!"
2372,"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
2373,@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
2374,@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
2375,@united since UA 1226 ORD-EWR is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in First?
2376,@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
2377,@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
2378,@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
2379,@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?

2387,@united Home is Calgary can you get us there without the added expense of accommodations and meals.
2388,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
2389,@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
2390,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.
2391,@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
2392,@united thank you for taking care of my mom and reFlight Booking Problems her flight in phl.
2393,"@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone."
2394,"@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr."
2395,@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?

2402,"@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?"
2403,@united terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days
2404,@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt

2471,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!

2490,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
2491,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
2492,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
2493,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
2494,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

2507,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
2508,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
2509,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
2510,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.

2520,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
2521,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
2522,@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!

2529,"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
2530,"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" 
My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
2531,@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
2532,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
2533,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"

2535,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
2536,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
2537,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
2538,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
2539,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
2540,@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

2648,@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
2649,@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
2650,@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
2651,"@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice"
2652,@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.

2659,@united I miss the Continental days.
2660,@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
2661,"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
2662,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
2663,"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
2664,"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"
2665,"@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold!"
2666,@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
2667,@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
2668,"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information."
2669,"@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening"

2673,@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
2674,@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
2675,@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
2676,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united
2677,@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
2678,@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
2679,@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
2680,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
2681,@united how much longer United?? Been on the phone for over an hour to straighten out a star alliance upgrade!!! http://t.co/U1ViEuiDF5
2682,@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?

2684,"@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos."
2685,@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
2686,"@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!"
2687,"Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you ""can't do anything"" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7"
2688,@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
2689,@united you guys suck!
2690,"@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot."
2691,@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..

2693,"@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember"
2694,@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
2695,@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad
2696,@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
2697,@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
2698,@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne.
2699,"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
2700,"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I‚Äôve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y‚Äôall every time!"
2701,"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
2702,"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
2703,@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
2704,"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
2705,@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
2706,@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
2707,@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
2708,@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
2709,@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
2710,@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
2711,@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
2712,@united give her the recognition she deserves!
2713,@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
2714,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
2715,@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
2716,@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
2717,@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
2718,"@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int‚Äôl leg, now I‚Äôm sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go"

2720,"@united Your ""Loyalty Team"" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google ""loyalty"" and get back to me? ^LOL"
2721,"Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks"
2722,@united Thank You
2723,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
2724,"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""
2725,@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
2726,. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
2727,@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
2728,@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
2729,@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
2730,@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
2731,@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
2732,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
2733,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
2734,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
2735,@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
2736,@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
2737,"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
2738,@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
2739,@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
2740,"@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall"
2741,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
2742,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
2743,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
2744,@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
2745,@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
2746,@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
2747,@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
2748,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! üëç
2749,@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
2750,@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
2751,"@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF"

2753,@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
2754,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
2755,@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies

2758,"@united Also, group 5 is total BS."
2759,@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
2760,"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
2761,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
2762,@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
2763,"@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?"
2764,@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
2765,"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd."
2766,@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
2767,@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
2768,@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
2769,@united this delay of flight UA4636 has been painful. I sure hope it doesn't cause me or my luggage) to miss my UA82 flight to New Delhi!
2770,@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
2771,‚Äú@united: @BattierCCIpuppy Your puppy is so cute. We look forward to having both of you on board. Thanks for the high five. ^EY‚Äù üëèüëè

2773,"@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it‚Äôs not 1997 anymore."
2774,@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.

2777,"@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight"
2778,@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
2779,"@united OK, thanks for the clarification."
2780,@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
2781,@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
2782,@united delayed another hour
2783,@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
2784,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
2785,@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
2786,"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
2787,"@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back."
2788,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
2789,@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
2790,@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn‚Äôt 1997!
2791,"@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo"
2792,@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
2793,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
2794,"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
2795,@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
2796,@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
2797,@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
2798,@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
2799,@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
2800,"@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week."
2801,@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
2802,@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
2803,@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
2804,@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
2805,@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji

2810,"@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS"
2811,".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
2812,"@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?"
2813,@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
2814,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
2815,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
2816,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
2817,@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
2818,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
2819,‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
2820,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
2821,@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
2822,@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
2823,"@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond"
2824,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
2825,"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
2826,@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
2827,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
2828,@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.

2846,"@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?"
2847,"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
2848,@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
2849,@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.

2857,@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.

2861,"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
2862,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
2863,@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
2864,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
2865,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
2866,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
2867,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
2868,@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
2869,@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
2870,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
2871,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
2872,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
2873,@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
2874,@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
2875,@united anything yet JJ?
2876,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
2877,@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
2878,@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
2879,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
2880,@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
2881,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
2882,@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
2883,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
2884,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
2885,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"

2890,@united Thanks!
2891,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
2892,@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
2893,@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
2894,"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"

2896,Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.

2898,@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
2899,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
2900,@united thanks for more timely updates.
2901,@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
2902,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
2903,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
2904,@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
2905,@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
2906,@united thanks. That means I have 30 minutes to make my international connection to HKG

2909,@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
2910,@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
2911,@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
2912,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
2913,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
2914,@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
2915,"@united well played, ^LO."
2916,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.

2925,@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
2926,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
2927,@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
2928,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
2929,"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."

2934,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help

2936,"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
2937,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
2938,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
2939,@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
2940,@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
2941,@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
2942,@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
2943,@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler

2952,@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
2953,@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!

2965,@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
2966,@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
2967,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
2968,@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
2969,@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
2970,@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
2971,"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."

3029,@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline

3119,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
3120,@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
3121,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
3122,@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
3123,@united round trip*
3124,"@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet."
3125,@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
3126,@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
3127,@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
3128,.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
3129,"@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!"
3130,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
3131,@united thnx
3132,@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
3133,@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
3134,@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
3135,@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
3136,@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
3137,@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
3138,"@united thanks, that would be awesome."

3143,@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
3144,"@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?"
3145,"@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?"
3146,"@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?"
3147,@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
3148,@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
3149,"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."
3150,@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
3151,@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
3152,@united - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us).  Help...

3157,"@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the ""soft landing"" policy of no more than 1 level?"
3158,@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
3159,"@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled"
3160,"@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family"
3161,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
3162,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
3163,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
3164,@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
3165,@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
3166,"@united thanks, keep up the good work"
3167,@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
3168,@united any solutions?
3169,@united what do you have in mind?
3170,@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
3171,@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
3172,@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
3173,@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
3174,@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
3175,@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
3176,@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
3177,"@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus"
3178,"@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks"
3179,@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
3180,@united What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
3181,@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. üòû
3182,@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
3183,.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
3184,@united that would be great - 1k us651621
3185,@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
3186,@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.

3189,@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
3190,"@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?"
3191,"@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match."
3192,@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.üò°
3193,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
3194,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
3195,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
3196,"@united @HiltonWorldwide @Caravannyc @MaysvilleNYC 
Let's go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC‚Ä¶as a tourist:

3201,@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
3202,@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN

3205,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
3206,@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
3207,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
3208,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
3209,"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
3210,"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
3211,@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
3212,@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
3213,@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X

3215,"@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are ‚Ç¨67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
3216,@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
3217,@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
3218,@united Leaving soon. Thanks!

3221,@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
3222,@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
3223,@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
3224,"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
3225,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
3226,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
3227,@united sent DM's
3228,@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
3229,@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
3230,@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
3231,@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
3232,@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
3233,@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
3234,@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
3235,@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.

3239,@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??

3250,@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
3251,@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
3252,@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!

3255,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
3256,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
3257,@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
3258,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
3259,"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
3260,"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont‚Ä¶"
3261,@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
3262,@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail

3268,@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
3269,@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
3270,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
3271,"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
3272,@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
3273,"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
3274,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
3275,@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
3276,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
3277,"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
3278,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
3279,"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
3280,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??

3301,@united perfect! Thank you!

3318,@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
3319,@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.

3597,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
3598,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
3599,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
3600,@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
3601,"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"
3602,"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
3603,@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
3604,@united thanks
3605,@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
3606,"@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1"

3649,@united Hi guys. I submitted a request for ticket/hotel reimbursement for a delayed/over night stay coming back from the Dominican. Help?
3650,"@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times."
3651,"@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?"
3652,@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
3653,@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
3654,"@united landing in anchorage, then on our way to fairbanks! http://t.co/FjkvQMbmaS"

Peace."
3659,@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
3660,@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
3661,@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
3662,@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
3663,"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï"
3664,@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
3665,"@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated."
3666,"@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded."

3670,"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"
3671,@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
3672,@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
3673,@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?

3678,"@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am"
3679,@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
3680,@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
3681,@united sent
3682,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
3683,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
3684,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
3685,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"
3686,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
3687,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
3688,"@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???"

3691,@united correct date is 2/11/15!
3692,@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
3693,@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
3694,"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."

3696,@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
3697,@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
3698,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
3699,"@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)"

3701,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
3702,@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
3703,@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
3704,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
3705,@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
3706,@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
3707,@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
3708,@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
3709,@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
3710,@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
3711,"@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation."
3712,@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.

3719,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
3720,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
3721,"@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?"
3722,"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
3723,@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
3724,@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
3725,"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"

3728,@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
3729,@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
3730,"@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)"
3731,@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
3732,"@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there."
3733,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
3734,"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
3735,@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
3736,"@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466"
3737,@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!

3739,@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
3740,"@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
3741,@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
3742,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"

3744,@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
3745,"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
3746,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
3747,@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
3748,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
3749,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
3750,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
3751,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
3752,@united thank you!
3753,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
3754,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
3755,"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
3756,@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
3757,"@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15"
3758,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
3759,"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
3760,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"

3762,"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
3763,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
3764,@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
3765,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
3766,@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
3767,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
3768,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
3769,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
3770,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"

3776,@united @ShulemStern @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
3777,@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
3778,"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"

3780,"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
3781,@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
3782,@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
3783,@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
3784,"@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
3785,@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.

3795,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
3796,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
3797,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
3798,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.

3805,@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
3806,"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
3807,@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
3808,@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.

3819,@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool

3937,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
3938,@united how come I have no baggage updates.
3939,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"

3944,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
3945,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
3946,@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
3947,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"

3950,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work

3956,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
3957,@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.

3966,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
3967,@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
3968,@united do you guys have any working planes?
3969,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
3970,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it."
3971,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
3972,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
3973,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
3974,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
3975,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
3976,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
3977,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
3978,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
3979,"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
3980,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
3981,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
3982,@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
3983,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
3984,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
3985,@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
3986,@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
3987,@united @annricord both!
3988,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
3989,@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
3990,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
3991,"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
3992,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
3993,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
3994,"@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum"
3995,"@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!üò¢ still no bag!"

3998,@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
3999,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
4000,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
4001,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
4002,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
4003,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
4004,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
4005,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?"
4006,@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
4007,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
4008,@united 618 was flight out of Houston
4009,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
4010,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
4011,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
4012,"@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them."

4061,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
4062,"@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson."
4063,@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
4064,"@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!"
4065,@united ooh thanks!
4066,"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
4067,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
4068,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
4069,"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
4070,"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
4071,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
4072,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
4073,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
4074,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
4075,"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
4076,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
4077,@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
4078,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
4079,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
4080,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
4081,@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
4082,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
4083,"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
4084,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
4085,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
4086,@united can you not see the thread?
4087,@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
4088,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
4089,@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
4090,@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
4091,@united thanks! :)
4092,"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
4093,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
4094,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
4095,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
4096,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
4097,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
4098,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
4099,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
4100,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
4101,@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé
4102,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
4103,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
4104,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
4105,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
4106,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
4107,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
4108,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
4109,"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
4110,@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
4111,@united Classic
4112,@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
4113,@united Thanks!
4114,"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
4115,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
4116,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
4117,@united no thanks
4118,"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
4119,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
4120,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
4121,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
4122,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
4123,@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
4124,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
4125,"@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300."
4126,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
4127,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
4128,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
4129,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
4130,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
4131,@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
4132,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
4133,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
4134,@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home
4135,"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
4136,@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
4137,@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
4138,@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
4139,"@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)"
4140,@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
4141,@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
4142,@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
4143,"@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com"
4144,@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
4145,"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
4146,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
4147,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
4148,"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
4149,@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
4150,@united for our birthdays my fianc√© &amp; I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
4151,@united I‚Äôm resending the confirmation code in a DM
4152,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
4153,@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
4154,"@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?"
4155,@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
4156,@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
4157,"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
4158,@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
4159,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
4160,@united worst service ever üòà
4161,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
4162,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
4163,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
4164,@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
4165,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
4166,@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
4167,@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..üò°...
4168,"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday"
4169,@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
4170,"@united done just now, thanks."
4171,@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
4172,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
4173,"@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number."
4174,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
4175,"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
4176,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
4177,@united can you send me another confirmation email?
4178,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
4179,@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
4180,"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
4181,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.

4183,"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
4184,@united thank you! üòä
4185,"@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!"
4186,@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
4187,@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
4188,@united customer service üëé
4189,@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
4190,"@united Hi again, any updates here?"
4191,@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
4192,@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
4193,.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
4194,@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
4195,@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
4196,"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
4197,"@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)"
4198,@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
4199,"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
4200,@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
4201,@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
4202,"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
4203,Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
4204,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
4205,@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
4206,@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
4207,@united you are really trying me today.
4208,@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
4209,@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
4210,@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
4211,@united was never given one
4212,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
4213,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
4214,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
4215,"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
4216,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
4217,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
4218,@united who can tell me where they are?
4219,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
4220,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
4221,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
4222,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
4223,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
4224,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
4225,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
4226,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
4227,"@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam"
4228,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
4229,"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
4230,@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
4231,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
4232,@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
4233,@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
4234,@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
4235,@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
4236,@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
4237,"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
4238,"@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus."
4239,@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
4240,@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
4241,"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
4242,@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
4243,@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
4244,"@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time"
4245,@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
4246,@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
4247,@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
4248,@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
4249,@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
4250,"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl"
4251,@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
4252,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
4253,@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
4254,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
4255,@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
4256,@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
4257,@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
4258,@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
4259,@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
4260,@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
4261,@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
4262,@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
4263,@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
4264,"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere
magazine with out flying?"
4265,@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
4266,"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
4267,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
4268,@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

4271,@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
4272,"@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
4273,"@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
4274,Thx! Stand by! ‚Äú@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH‚Äù
4275,"@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?"
4276,"@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?"
4277,@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
4278,@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
4279,"@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!"
4280,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
4281,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
4282,@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
4283,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
4284,.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
4285,"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
4286,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
4287,@united I appreciate the follow up.
4288,@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
4289,@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
4290,"@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
4291,@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
4292,@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
4293,@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
4294,@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!

4299,@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!

4301,@united why am i mot getting my refund?
4302,.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
4303,@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
4304,@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
4305,@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
4306,@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
4307,"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"
4308,@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
4309,"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"
